# Health_Data


Daily food reports were collected over a two week period using my Net Diary and transferred into an excel file for processing. Only the main five categories Calories, Fat, Carbs, Protein, and fiber were kept as fields with each row representing a day. All categories except calories were recorded in grams

Movement data was collected using the StepsApp and exported as a csv file. Data consisted of  date, steps, duration, distance, calories, and floors. Duration, calories, and floors were measured in seconds, meters, kcals, and 3 meter increments respectively.

Water intake data was recorded using the Water Reminder app and transferred into an excel file for processing. Fields consisted of date and water intake measured in ounces with each row representing a day.
